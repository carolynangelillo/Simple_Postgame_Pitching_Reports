# Simple_Postgame_Pitching_Reports
This was code developed during my summer 2023 internship with the Upper Valley Nighthawks. 

The goal was to produce simple, quick .txt files containing postgame pitching statistics, with info drawn from Trackman CSV files, 
as well as making this code accessible to and usable by those who had little or no experience with Python.

While this code was intially structured to work with Trackman files, changing the column/variable names should allow you to use it with any type
of software.

For those using Trackman data- this code is designed to work with files implementing the "Tagged Pitch Type" option. If your Trackman
CSV implements "Auto Pitch Type" simply replace any mention of "TaggedPitchType" with "AutoPitchType"
